# Driver_drowsiness_detection_system
**Drowsiness of the drivers is the main cause of accidents in the world as well as India. Due to lack of sleep and tiredness, drowsiness can occur while driving. The best way to avoid accidents caused by driversâ€™ drowsiness is to detect drowsiness of the driver and warn him before fall into sleep. To detect drowsiness many techniques like eye retina detection, facial feature recognition has been used. Here in this report, we propose a method of detecting driver drowsiness using eye retina detection of the driver. In this report, we propose a more accurate drowsiness detection method which is a hybrid approach of eye retina detection .**

# First it detects the eyes on the screen

# Then starts the count of blinking from zero along with time limit
